  English Translations. Also the base for new translations.
  
  NOTE TO TRANSLATORS:
   - If you can, I'd love to hear about the well-received Bibles in your language that
     are freely available for our use.
   - If you find misspelled or missing keys, please let me know by adding an issue
     to the GitHub repository for this project.
   - If you are unsure of the context of an object, please ask. I've placed comments
     to help, but they may not be sufficient.
   - It is possible that where the same word is used in English, the translation may be
     different based on context. I very likely haven't planned for that -- so feel free
     to add an issue. I'll make a fix and send you the revised key.
   - Oh, and thanks for being willing to help!
