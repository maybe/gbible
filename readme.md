*Why are the assets and Bible Database missing?*
It is unfortunate that people would take the code and re-release it on the app store while replacing the attribution required. As such, I've told Git to ignore the graphical assets, as they are not covered under the license. While easy to circumvent, hopefully it will convince such unscrupulous developers to look elswhere. Furthermore, removing the Bible Database further complicates matters -- it is trivial to reconstruct, but difficult enough to dissuade unscrupulous developers. For legitimate development information, see: https://github.com/photokandyStudios/gbible/wiki/Bible-Database and https://github.com/photokandyStudios/gbible/wiki/Missing-Assets.

*NOTE*: The graphical assets are not covered under the above license. They are copyright their respective owners.

The following developers are excluded from the above license, by virtue of previous infringement:

 * The developer named Wang Ting (and any other aliases) is hereby denied license to use any of this code without prior authorization. This is in response to the unauthorized release of a copy of this application on the App Store in December 2012 under the names "Bible : Greek Interlinear Bible Free" and "Bible : Greek Interlinear Bible". The first is ad-supported, which clearly goes against the non-commercial clause of the license. The second is not free, which also goes against the non-commercial license. In both cases, attribution has been changed to the developer, and so the license is again ingringed. Finally, the app uses the graphical assets as provided, again a clear infringment as these are not licensed under the code license.
